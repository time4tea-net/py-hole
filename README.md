# Py-Hole

py-hole is a network-level ad blocker, that blocks ads for your whole home or business network!

This is a small thing inspired by pi-hole, unfortunately the installation
of pi-hole did too many things for me, so I wanted the same thing, but less
complicated. You could check out pi-hole too - it may be just the right thing for you.

py-hole uses dnsmasq for its DNS resolution capabilities.

# Thanks

Thanks to the pi-hole project for much awesome work and inspiration

# No warranty / No implied warranty or suitability

This program comes with no warranty, we don't even imply that it is fit for the purpose of blocking ads.

The program uses lists of domains on the internet that the user can configure.

# Install It!

This software is *alpha* quality at best. It may not work for you, or even at all. 

```
wget -qO - 'https://bintray.com/user/downloadSubjectPublicKey?username=time4tea' | sudo apt-key add
echo "deb https://dl.bintray.com/time4tea/py-hole time4tea free" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install py-hole
```

This installation will add some dnsmasq configuration to /etc/dnsmasq.d, but it *will not* change
your existing installation. 

It will also NOT change any iptables rules, NOR install php, webservers or anything else. This means
that if your py-hole box is also your DSL gateway all your current firewall settings are intact... Yay!

# Configure It!

You may need to edit /etc/py-hole/py-hole.json to put in the address of your py-hole machine... if you change it then
run

```
sudo /opt/py-hole/py-hole
sudo service dnsmasq reload
```

to regenerate the config, which will happen automatically every night

# Test It!

Assuming you installed py-hole on a server with IP Address 192.168.0.1, try the following command on another 
machine on your network

```
nslookup google.com 192.168.0.1
```

If its working, it should print something like:

```
Server:		192.168.0.1
Address:	192.168.0.1#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:	google.com
Address: 172.217.23.14
```

# Configure It!

You'll need to configure your DHCP server, which may be your DSL router, to give out the address of the py-hole
box as the DNS server, rather than the ISP defaults.
